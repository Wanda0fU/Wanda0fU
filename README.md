# Warning

"No man ascends a mountain without first weathering the storm. To claim the summit, you must surrender comfort, fear, and certainty. This is the Iron Law of Ascent: every peak demands its toll in sweat and resolve. We are fools to believe greatness is gifted, not earned."

â€” *Ascribed to the Wanderer-King of Stoic Lore*
