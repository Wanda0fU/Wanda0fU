**``Digital Architect (Developer/Security Researcher/Innovator)``**

Iâ€™m an independent full-stack web developer and cybersecurity researcher, crafting secure and innovative systems one project at a time. From designing and coding to solving real-world security challenges, my approach is grounded in precision and efficiency.
Every project I work on is carefully planned and executed, prioritizing both functionality and security. My focus is on developing high-performance web applications while uncovering [vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computer_security)) and enhancing digital safety.

I shape the code that shapes the future.
